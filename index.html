        <h2>A Life Full of Love and Laughter</h2>
        <p>Petuel Jean-Francois was born on May 12, 1950, in the beautiful island of Lagonav, Haiti. In the late 1980s, he made the brave journey to America, where he would meet the love of his life, my mother. Together, they built a life filled with love, laughter, and countless cherished memories.</p>
        <p>One of my fondest memories of my dad is his incredible ability to do a spot-on impression of Donald Duck. No matter how tired he was after a long day of hard work, he could always make us laugh with his playful impersonations and his infectious laughter. He’s a man who loves to laugh, and his joy is truly contagious.</p>
        
        <h2>The Simple Pleasures</h2>
        <p>Dad has a few simple pleasures in life that always bring him happiness. On road trips, his go-to snacks are peanuts and a cold Mountain Dew. He still gives me a hard time about my love of spicy food, which my mom and I find endlessly amusing. Despite his playful complaints, he always makes sure our road trips are filled with warmth and love.</p>
        <p>And oh, how he loves his pizza! Deep dish, piled high with everything—no pizza is too big or too bold for my dad.</p>
        
        <h2>A Devoted Father and Faithful Catholic</h2>
        <p>Despite the long hours he worked, my dad was never too tired to lend an ear or offer advice. He’s the kind of man who would drop everything to listen if you needed to talk. His deep Catholic faith has guided him throughout his life, providing him with strength and comfort even in the toughest of times.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Journey with Alzheimer's</h2>
        <p>Currently, my dad is battling late-stage Alzheimer's. It's a difficult journey, but it's one we face together as a family, drawing strength from the love he has always shown us. This tribute is not only a way to celebrate the incredible man he is but also to offer support and resources for those who might be going through similar experiences.</p>
